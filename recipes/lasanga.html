        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>500 grams pork and beef miced meet</li>
            <li>1 onion (finely chopped)</li>

            <li>400 grams tomato passata</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>salt and pepper</li>
            <li>50 grams of real butter</li>
            <li>50 grams of flower</li>
            <li>500ml of milk</li>
            <li>pinch of nutmeg</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>12 lasanga sheets (fresh or dried)</li>
            <li>150 grams of grated parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preperation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Chop your vegetables. Make them as finely chopped as possible.</li>
            <li>Heat up a little olive oil in a pan. Once up to temperature add the onion, carrot and celery. Cook until it starts to go soft.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic and cook for another minute or so.</li>
            <li>Add the minced meet and cook until golden brown. Break it into small pieces.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato puree and cook for about a minute. Then add the tomato passata, red wine, oregano, basil, salt and pepper. Mix thoroughly and bring to a boil. Once at a boil turn down the heat and let simmer for 30-40 minutes.</li>
            <li>In the meantime prepare the bechamel sauce. Melt the butter in a pan on low to medium heat. Once melted add the flower and stir to form a roux. Slowly add milk while stirring to avoid clumps. Let it thicken until you get a nice and smooth b&eacute;chamel sauce. Add a pinch of nutmeg and salt to flavor. Be careful not to overdo it with the nutmeg or it can overpower the flavor of the sauce.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 180&ordm; C. If using fresh lasanga sheets check cooking instructions.</li>
            <li>Time to start layering. Start with a layer of sauce and make it as thin as possible. You're basically just using the sauce as a coating. Add a couple of lasanga sheets, followed by a layer of b&eacute;chamel sauce. Repeat these steps until all ingredients are gone, ending with a layer of bolognese sauce. Sprinkle with a good layer of grated parmesan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven for 30-40 minutes or until the top starts to become golden brown. If it gets too dark you can cover it with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Take the lasanga out of the oven and let it settle for a few minutes so it can firm up and it becomes easier to slice.</li>
            <li>Cut up the lasanga and serve. If desired you can garnish it with some fresh basil or parsely.</li>
        </ol>
